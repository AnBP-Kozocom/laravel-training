- Each integer when it's stored on a computer, it's often expressed as 32 ones (we say that integer can be expressed with 32 bits) 
  - A "bit" = 1 or 0
  - Sample: 
    - 1 -> 0000...01
    - 2 -> 0000...10
- Memory can be thought of as "a long tape if bytes"
  - A "byte" = a small unit of data
- Each integer is 4 bytes
